The idea behind the project is to utilize pose
estimation to effectively analyse workouts and
provide visual cues to correct the posture during
workouts to prevent long term injuries, muscular
imbalances and also engage the muscles
effectively for a proper workout. In this project I
have explored the mediapipe platform from
google and utilised its pose estimation
framework to track a single workout and derive
various insights.I have also explored various
applications of pose estimation which I have
summarized in the applications and future work
section.
